/// A debug wrapper for [`release::Arena`].
///
/// The problem with [`super::ScratchArena`] is that it only "borrows" an underlying
/// [`release::Arena`]. Once the [`super::ScratchArena`] is dropped it resets the watermark
/// of the underlying [`release::Arena`], freeing all allocations done since borrowing it.
///
/// It is completely valid for the same [`release::Arena`] to be borrowed multiple times at once,
/// *as long as* you only use the most recent borrow. Bad example:
/// ```should_panic
/// use edit::arena::scratch_arena;
///
/// let mut scratch1 = scratch_arena(None);
/// let mut scratch2 = scratch_arena(None);
///
/// let foo = scratch1.alloc_uninit::<usize>();
///
/// // This will also reset `scratch1`'s allocation.
/// drop(scratch2);
///
/// *foo; // BOOM! ...if it wasn't for our debug wrapper.
/// ```
///
/// To avoid this, this wraps the real [`release::Arena`] in a "debug" one, which pretends as if every
/// instance of itself is a distinct [`release::Arena`] instance. Then we use this "debug" [`release::Arena`]
/// for [`super::ScratchArena`] which allows us to track which borrow is the most recent one.
